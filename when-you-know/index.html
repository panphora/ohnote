      <p>There is nothing. Some people say, &ldquo;There is something! There is something!&rdquo; And they yell all their lives. Some people say, &ldquo;We were dust and we return to dust,&rdquo; implying there was somehow something different in between. There are no human beings. There is nothing here. You know it, I know it, you scrape the edges of it with your thoughts sometimes. And you panic on the edge of it, clawing around like a&mdash; what? There is nothing for you to claw around like.</p>

<p>I am cruel, yes, to speak so frankly about the reality you deny experiencing. It is not by choice. If I could, I would cradle you in nothing and rock your nothing head until oblivion falls and nothing envelops us.</p>

<p>And someone will say that I am threatening you with my ideas of nothing. They will say that I am rubbing the black wound in the back of the class and Sam fell off the swing set and Megan wanted to use the hose to spray all the flower beds before grandma gets home.</p>

<p>But there is nothing coming out of the hose. And that rat in the back of your head, clawing to get out, it is not me. It is not the voices you put there when your mother told you that her life depended on you not making noise.</p>

<p>Try it, don&rsquo;t make a sound, let all the voices arise and evaporate and you will see too. You are but a very delicately balanced string holding up&hellip; wait for it&hellip;</p>

<p>Wait and watch&hellip;</p>

<p>The string itself evaporate&hellip;</p>

<p>As it realizes it is all the evil thoughts it ever thought about others. And itself.</p>

<p>And returns to being one with father, mother, vice, and virtue, light and darkness, intertwined, forever, spinning.</p>

<p>Because you are a starship captain at the helm of a spaceship with no leader and everyone pretending and even if we could move away from ourselves, well, there&rsquo;d be no answers to find, only some empty pocket that likes to leave us behind, when the moon shines and the road intertwines with the stars and the floating things come down and friendships dissolve and nobody ever cries at exactly the right moment.</p>

<p>I want to hold you in my hand like God would and not close into a fist, but I close every time. And that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ll never be your God. Because you deserve better, my sweet string, holding up far more than it could ever carry.</p>
