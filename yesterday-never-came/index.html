      <p>I watched, waited, sometimes knew what was coming, I stayed, I waited, watched for you on the train, knew you were coming someday, knew the light would flood the streets, the car would pull up, and you, dear you, with eyes like sunlight, would step out into my arms, and oh, I&rsquo;d hold you and we&rsquo;d kiss in the moonlight, but your eyes, full of sunlight, would shoot up to the moon and blur it&rsquo;s fuzzy light into oblivion, and the moon, the jealous moon, would tell the sun, and the sun would send spaceships from its core on a secret mission to find out who you are, and it would find out that you are the same, the core that lives within you is the core that lives within the sun, converting subatomic particles to higher forms of energy by the process known as magic, which rules the universe and the beings would get out of their car and come up behind us while I was holding you and you&rsquo;d seen it coming, in fact set up our whole relationship just for this scene, them clamping something on the back of your neck, and dragging you into the car, and me, forlorn on the street corner, stranded in front of the movie theatre, I&rsquo;d watch you go, as if everything at once was leaving their soul behind, but letting their bodies get carried away by the tide, she&rsquo;d take you back to the core of the sun, and you&rsquo;d party like it was 1999 and you&rsquo;d see that it was all a sham, including me, including the story that was that night, that kiss, did we even kiss, yes I remember it clearly now, that kiss in front of the movie theatre just before we went in and saw Jackie Chan jump over that fence in that movie with Concords in the title, and I gasped and frowned and beat my eye lashes at the flashes, the movie cinematographers flirting with me through a mix-match of colors on the screen, oh how they flirt, playful is my favorite, but sharp spikes to the heart work too when all you understand is anger or want to pretend like it&rsquo;s all you understand just to spite all those little hearts that&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t speak your language, you buzzing like a puppet on a screen, heart pulsing like a wildfire, sitting next to me, my soul, my life, my one true hold, the fire flight of too many fishes swimming through the aquarium of my skin all at once, but you see it all, and not in <sup>20</sup>&frasl;<sub>20</sub>, but in the moment, like you can see with your body, like you are, you understand, the heart of the ever burning sun, begging us all with every breath to understand also that everything, everything at once is crying the biggest, longest sob in recorded history and it&rsquo;s a shame to be a part of it without knowing it, because, as we all know, practicing for the main event, that gasp before the final sniffle, that audible thing, that expulsion that is a sob, that, we are practicing for, with every breath, knowing that the climax of sadness is just as meaningful, just as patterned and breathless and necessary for the language of what it means not for human/animal/or earth herself, but for the ever reaching expanse that you will never reach the end of because she&rsquo;s crawling ever away from you and you, you are regretting every second of it, pulling away from the expanse that some call love because all they see is hate, and some call spirit because all they see are lies, and some call life because all they see is what we point them to, marching along into the longest song that you&rsquo;ll ever hear, hating yourself for all the life you could not breathe in, hating yourself for accepting, way back when, that lie they told you but hesitate to remember because we never believe what we do not want to be true.</p>
