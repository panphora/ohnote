      <p>Reaching, reaching, finding, not looking, just going with it and seeing that it&rsquo;s all there, all the time, that it&rsquo;s more than can ever be said and why say it, when you&rsquo;re making it up, when you&rsquo;re not even part of it, you are it, the only thing, why question, why wait, why not dive in when it doesn&rsquo;t matter, when it&rsquo;s all the same, because it&rsquo;s not, because there&rsquo;s divisions, shells, things that matter, and though the world will end, maybe some of us will slip through and oh, I mean oh my god, if you can just let us through the gates into the other side, reach through that big ball of light and lift us up into somewhere that doesn&rsquo;t feel so heavy, we will love you.</p>

<p>You see, there&rsquo;s two types of people, the people who live here, feel the world, define our language by speaking, and there&rsquo;s those of us who live on the edges, take test tastes, not looking directly, feeling around the way the words sound in our mouth, chew up and empty our brains every night, and don&rsquo;t look back, not ever, at the spectre of something that&rsquo;s eating us, devouring us, every day, every time we look it directly in the eyes, holding close to our chest the idea that there&rsquo;s something more.</p>

<p>And then, I hope, there are those who let go, those who feel the energy of earth and sun pass through the universe, feel the energy light up their being, because it&rsquo;s there, this infinite power, we just can&rsquo;t handle it, ever, and see us go back into the caves we remember somehow, somewhere in a memory that is not really a memory, but just a feeling, a thing, a little vibration, and you&rsquo;ll see us sneak up there and peak out only when it suits us, only when you all admit that it&rsquo;s just a game, that we can really this time stop being scared. Because it&rsquo;s just us here, just us, and yet we&rsquo;re all backed up against the wall of a god who neither cares nor knows he exists.</p>
