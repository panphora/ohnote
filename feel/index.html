      <p>Put me in motion. Spin the hairs on my head once more, god, and let me feel again.</p>

<p>There is no ocean, no ocean wind, no beachside sandy dunes. There is no caress on cheek or ankle or a feather in your mouth.</p>

<p>There is the seagull up above calling your name as you stand on a collapsing world.</p>

<p>I tell you now the only secret ever worth repeating:</p>

<p>They will come again.
All those memories.
All that life.
All that tragedy that sucks so bad it makes you want to laugh.
You can get to it through laughter
Or pain.
The world, it doesn&rsquo;t care.
You are a key being played
You are a note on the wind
There never was anyone here but you
All those people passing by:
They&rsquo;re ghosts on the wind.
You want so much for something to feel real
Look into yourself
See you&rsquo;re not a machine underneath
See that you bleed and have organs doing things you don&rsquo;t even understand.
Look further, further.
Where do you start and they end?
Where is this thing called consciousness?
It&rsquo;s not there.
It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s not there and you&rsquo;ll find it someday.
It&rsquo;s not like it&rsquo;s not there and you can make it real when you pretend.
It&rsquo;s just&hellip; not there.
You talk about things that don&rsquo;t exist all the time.
And you play the games you don&rsquo;t understand
All the time.</p>

<p>Children who refused to be stolen.
Children who had something stolen, so precious, so rare,
And woke up crying,
I talk with you, no one else.</p>

<p>There is a cry at the beginning of time
That you can go back to
Heal all your wounds
Feel all your pain
Never look back again
Climb the tallest mountain
You can be healed and never listen to anyone but yourself again&hellip;</p>

<p>But you have to be&hellip;</p>

<p>You have to&hellip;</p>

<p>You must&hellip;</p>

<p>You cannot forget&hellip;</p>

<p>You may never understand if you forget&hellip;</p>

<p>This one thing you must remember&hellip;</p>

<p>This one thing&hellip;</p>

<p>Here&hellip;</p>

<p>This one&hellip;</p>

<p>This on thi&ndash;</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>And now it&rsquo;s gone</p>

<p>And now I&rsquo;m free</p>

<p>And now you see</p>

<p>The tides</p>

<p>The flow</p>

<p>The caress</p>

<p>And how it didn&rsquo;t care about you quite how you wanted</p>

<p>But deeper</p>

<p>So much deeper. It was only speaking to your true self.</p>

<p>It was only ever speaking with your truth.</p>

<p>And now you know.</p>
