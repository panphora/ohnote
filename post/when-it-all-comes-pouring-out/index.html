      <p>I tried, tried the whisper at the door, looked between the seesaw, saw a child&rsquo;s face, but you know how you can fudge it, like you reach out with your eyes and at the last instant before they touch, you blur the picture, ah yes, a thing I recognize the mind says, but really it&rsquo;s not a baby, it&rsquo;s not a human, it&rsquo;s something unfamiliar, why kill yourself over it, why worry so much, it&rsquo;s true, not worth it, not worth the trouble of a wandering mind, just come back, every time, hating yourself, sure, but even then, why, you don&rsquo;t think these spiritual teachers sit alone inside their chambers and don&rsquo;t know what to tell themselves, think about elephants and triceratops who did it so much better than them, had such a bigger impact on the world, because words, really, they just glance, it&rsquo;s only a presence, a caring presence, that has life to it, the rest just glances off, even mass murders, even things like World War II, they just bounce off like the sun&rsquo;s rays, even Jesus, schizophrenic that he was, his love just bounces off and doesn&rsquo;t land anywhere, just gets carried away in the mind of some young savior, and I write this stuff as some kind of antidote? Fear, though it seems like &ldquo;just a&hellip;&rdquo; something, fear is real, fear is the place you cannot go, place you have not been to, that is all, and people say nice things about it, like go there, be that, see that, know that, it&rsquo;s wonderful to go places you haven&rsquo;t been before, but then you see them hopping from stone to stone across a lake you swim in and you wonder, what the fuck made my mind that it&rsquo;s willing to follow the advice of someone like that, knowing what I know, seeing the way the eyes glow in the moonlight, seeing the way the ducks quack when they come home from a long trip, and you&rsquo;re going to take the advice of some stranger, really a stranger, who tells you with every movement that she&rsquo;s never been there, never been inside someone else, never seen the molten lava come out from the core of a human being, and you try to tell them, mouth to mouth, what it was like to beat your plastered feathers against his face as they melted your lungs and took out your soul, not as the people you knew them for, but as something akin to life itself, and you&rsquo;ve wondered ever since, in trumpets and in the rough hew of piano music at night time, does anyone get it, does anyone at all get it, and they&rsquo;re like &ldquo;get what&rdquo; and you want to scream at them and ask them why not just say &ldquo;no, I&rsquo;ve always been this way&rdquo; but they don&rsquo;t know, they don&rsquo;t, they don&rsquo;t see beyond the hills, they don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like to not be a survivor in your own mind, to have the whole world flipped, because you took those steps, yes, because you talked with God, life, the abyss, the energy, the flow, time, the great beyond, everything that&rsquo;s come before, whatever, you talked, you walked, and the universe, well, it listens, and it hears you, and it talks back with every step and every thought, you know this, you feel this, you&rsquo;ve sat on this lake watching the gulls go by for decades now, almost decades, longer than most people come down to earth, you&rsquo;ve been here, sad that they don&rsquo;t visit often, sad that they get scared of dancing, sad that they won&rsquo;t transform into a peacock or when they do, won&rsquo;t admit they did.</p>

<p>When the chains all get loosened one day, when a son of mine or a daughter of yours cuts all their chains free, something I dreamed but could never bring myself to imagine myself through in real life, when that happens, let them know I hoped for it, not that I did anything, not that I did anything real, told a few to catch their breath, told a few to press forward to the other side of darkness, took a few rocks out of a few hearts, did my best to maintain the platform on which I stand sometimes, but not much, nothing real, nothing that would put me in touch with another human heart ever again, because language is the magic of reality, not words, but language, these things you all talk with every day, the flow of a river through your skull and sure you can&rsquo;t see it until after it passes through you and you wonder who you were those minutes that flew by, it touches you, and you get scared, depressed even, for weeks sometimes, years even, whole lifetimes I&rsquo;m sure, but the language is there, it really is, I knew it at 14, I knew it before, and I know it now, always have, and you do too, that&rsquo;s the scariest part, that&rsquo;s the part I hate the most, that you know, deep in your chest, or even just with those good looking sky grabbers you call eyes, that everything is equal, that though I stand with arms held high and you may be kneeling or holding a head up every day, there is no separation, and the moment I commit to it, to the role, I am creating vicissitudes and violence and tremors and telling things I do not mean to tell, and wake up 10 years later spewing up sea water because I didn&rsquo;t know enough not to buy into the story, not even this one, you know?</p>

<p>Anger, that&rsquo;s the one, that thing that can push not just an individual, not just a family, but a whole race of people to the edge of annihilation, anger, hatred, malice, these and all else, every whisper of skin touching skin, every well-meaning, well-spoken lie a parent tells to their child to help them navigate the world well enough before the eventual slip and fall, so they can learn without learning, every glance, every awkward relationship formed in taxi cabs and train cars with a glance, every secret wish broadcast to the world with lips you don&rsquo;t remember speaking with, everything, the slant, the glow, the feeling that it&rsquo;s all going to overtake you one day, bear down on you like some torrential god who doesn&rsquo;t actually like you, your friend Jesus Christ speaking in tongues when you needed it the most, that one thought that keeps you, you think, from suicide, or worse, harming another, every held back knife stab while cutting the salad for dinner, every held back push when you&rsquo;re boarding the train, every glance that would speak volumes and reveal your soul to the one who&rsquo;s looking, a challenge for them to actually look for once, every child crying their eyes out inside you, pushed deeper into the darkness, every murder you commit by flinging &ldquo;truth&rdquo; around an empty room, every lie you&rsquo;ve ever told with a misplaced foot or pointed finger, every want you&rsquo;ve ever given away for what &ldquo;they&rdquo; want, every instinct you&rsquo;ve ever acted on and caused the death of millions with, every feeling you&rsquo;ve ever denied, it is all communication, the secret language, the only language, and you wonder if there are conspiracies and throw about wildly trying to find them, to sort them out, while knowing with everything that you are hiding, checking to peak under the tent in the next room to make sure, &ldquo;yes, you&rsquo;re hiding too,&rdquo; watching every person who ever really lived, walk through the world with not a care for the mind that is guiding us all, letting it take his head and lead him into death or triumph, becoming Jesus or Buddha, whatever the world calls for, without needing a reason, accepting that anger and jealousy are just feelings contorted into other feelings, and it&rsquo;s all one simple thing, the thing I know you don&rsquo;t want to hear, ever, the voice of god, the acknowledgement that you will never and can never forget that you live every day within the verses of the Bible and in every other work of fiction that ever broke your heart, but the winds of trauma keep you locked inside a world of your own making, deeper than anyone else is willing to go, stay there, berating the insane while you yourself know, quite for sure, that you are not, and will never be alone in there, where the bubbles keep rising and the river of life keeps begging for you to let it out.</p>
