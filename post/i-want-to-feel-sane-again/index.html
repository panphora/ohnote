      <p>I tried to bury it in the back yard, took out a shovel and picked up some dirt.</p>

<p>The shovel became an extension of my arm.</p>

<p>There is no room in this world for shovel-arms.</p>

<p>So, at night some times, I uncork my brain and let it flow into the galaxy. I feel the light from stars you&rsquo;ve never even seen.</p>

<p>And then, in the morning, I put on my human suit and march to the tune of the worst, most depressing shit I&rsquo;ve ever heard in my life.</p>

<p>The funny thing about dying is it doesn&rsquo;t matter. Teenagers test you with this sometimes, with looks like they just don&rsquo;t want to be here any more.</p>

<p>And you could tell them the truth: We wouldn&rsquo;t really miss you after a few years and we&rsquo;d hate ourselves for it, but our shame for being creatures that exist in ever-passing time would far outstrip the amount of time we&rsquo;d spend thinking about you. Or praying that you made it to heaven.</p>

<p>Why would you tell them the truth?</p>

<p>Because it&rsquo;s what they want to hear. It&rsquo;s what they need to hear.</p>

<p>We do things these days make no sense. Have funerals, put people in boxes under the ground. You send your husband off to work, do the same thing, see the longing in his eyes for something more. Bury it because he buried yours.</p>

<p>Is everyone unhappy? That&rsquo;s a silly question. Of course not.</p>

<p>I wish I could caress your skin and see you glow in the sunlight.</p>

<p>Remember when I was younger and everything bounced off of me, before you got under my skin? Remember the world when it felt new and my eyes soaked it up and I didn&rsquo;t have to fight and claw my way back to reality every few weeks?</p>

<p>What is this?</p>

<p>I am stuck in hell. I want to convince you that you are too, but it hasn&rsquo;t been working.</p>

<p>Every time I think I&rsquo;m saying something like, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in hell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other person just nods and says, &ldquo;Yes, I agree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But then when I say, &ldquo;Well, shouldn&rsquo;t you hate it here?&rdquo; They respond, &ldquo;No, are you insane, this is how it&rsquo;s supposed to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And I know what&rsquo;s going on in their tiny brains, or at least I pretend to. I imagine their brain is 10% a tiny, beautiful creature that&rsquo;s basking in the glow and happiness of being alive and 90% terrified to its bones about being either cut off from everyone they love or engulfed in the meaninglessness of it all.</p>

<p>And every time, at every single stupid fucking opportunity, they make the choice to save the 10% sniveling little jerk of a spoiled child by sacrificing 90% of their consciousness, connection to the world, and love for their fellow human beings.</p>

<p>I say, take the risk, kill yourself. 100%. Then, if you rise again, you&rsquo;re worth it. But if not, at least you&rsquo;re not pretending we like you here.</p>

<p>But this hasn&rsquo;t been working out either.</p>

<p>I say this stuff to upset you.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t say it because I believe it.</p>

<p>But then, I kind of want someone to come along and say, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wrong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m in the mood for arguing.</p>

<p>But things get fuzzy at a certain point.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ve gotten decent, I think, at standing on the edge of the fuzziness and saying, &ldquo;Come at me, bro.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure. There&rsquo;s no way to know for sure. Because every time I think I&rsquo;m doing this, there might be a little wrestling, sure, but not much. And, in the end, I feel lonely. And afraid. And I get some strange looks sometimes.</p>

<p>So&hellip; what?</p>

<p>Well, lately I&rsquo;ve been thinking about treating myself kindly, gently. Taking the time to talk with myself to hash things out. And being gentle with the way I feel instead of trying to force it into some pre-existing structure or memory.</p>

<p>Because I think, when it comes down to it, all of my complaints against you are not entirely your fault, world.</p>

<p>I think, it&rsquo;s possible, that the world exists in me as much as I exist in it. And when I tell you, I don&rsquo;t feel like I can move around freely inside of you, I&rsquo;m also kind of begging myself to please find a way to move around more freely.</p>

<p>The problem, especially with this modern age, is that I can remain distracted from my problems, no matter how small or large, for decades.</p>

<p>And again, I talk of something external, the modern age.</p>

<p>But, if I think about it, I think it&rsquo;s possible the age is not the problem. That maybe it&rsquo;s not that there is a problem. But that life is heavy and we all have ways of dealing with it. And that&rsquo;s okay.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>I mean, if you really want ultimate solutions, that&rsquo;s the ticket.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve gotta find somewhere you feel comfortable standing, no matter if it lines up with the truth or not.</p>

<p>Because the truth changes. But if you feel comfortable standing where you&rsquo;re standing, nothing can shake you. And, as of now, that is taken for the mark of sanity more than any other quality.</p>

<p>Nations will fall to their knees for one person who doesn&rsquo;t shake or squander their thoughts.</p>

<p>And when I say nations, I mean fingers, toes, all the appendages, and the brain too. Give that brain of yours a safe place to relax into and no one will come knocking. But that has to be the focus. I think. I think there can be nothing else.</p>

<p>I think that&rsquo;s, as far as I understand it, the complete struggle of being human.</p>

<p>Being confined to a room that is what you feel and, while being curious about what happens outside this room, being content with the knowledge that it is beyond what you are&hellip;</p>
