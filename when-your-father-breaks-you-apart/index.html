      <p>Write what you don&rsquo;t know yet: Uh, ya, <strong>UNGH</strong>! Push it, women aren&rdquo;t the only ones who get pregnant &mdash;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the whine of time comes undone, when the slit that&rsquo;s above us open up, when time comes unreaveled, what will he say, your father&hellip; ?</p>

<p>Two shots was all it tooks to kill Mark Goolingstein, he watched from behind his fear as they took his body away, didn&rsquo;t want to see what it was like to die, though it would be the last thing he ever saw</p>

<p>Rather, the story</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s all stories, interwoven</p>

<p>&mdash; Only for those not looking</p>

<p>Stop arguing with yourself and write, goddddamnit</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the fuss? They could kills me, slit my throat, and I&rsquo;d bleed out. And you know WHAT? There is no you, never was, never will be, not now or in the future, so help me god, so say it:</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t exist. I don&rsquo;t exist. We never did.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re thinking ant colonies and I&rsquo;m thinking no: I asked for the blast and I got it, didn&rsquo;t know how to take it yet, but I got it, been struggling up the side of the bucket full of human crabs my whole life trying to take it</p>

<p>Now I see</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing, not even nothing</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like a bunch of mirrors trying to look in the mirror</p>

<p>Do you get it, Hitler? Do you get it, Mother Theresa? Do you get it, Satan&hellip; God himself? Whatever? They&rsquo;re in you and they&rsquo;re bleeding out for you to let them go. Let them go. Do it.</p>

<p>Find whatever you see when you see it.</p>

<p>I mean, watch it: There&rsquo;s nothing there. That fear, what is it? Well, now it&rsquo;s something. Great job, Einstein, great job, Freud.</p>

<p>Are you proud of the world you built, children searching the catacombs for what you lost?</p>

<p>Let me say it straight: you do not love, you do not hate, you do not fear, you do not wish kindness on strangers, you do not pain with longing, you do not do any of this.</p>

<p>You do not even pretend to.</p>

<p>Do you understand</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing hiding</p>

<p>Do you understand</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not there. There&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s nothing there.</p>

<p>Just look
Take fear, right, take the fear of life, which we all have and mangle into a million different forms and breathe life into it over and over and over and fucking look: LOOK. See that blow up doll you fuck until it bleeds. That&rsquo;s you motherfucker, that&rsquo;s not fear. That&rsquo;s you. So Stop WISHING it away.</p>

<p>Get it: right now you are the world. Kill yourself, you kill the world. Love the world, you love yourself.</p>

<p>See Hitler, triumph of triumphs, stuck in our heads until we hear our beating hearts: what is a Hitler compared to a heart beat. Wrong line of questioning&hellip;</p>

<p>So, wish, wish, wish</p>

<p>They don&rsquo;t see me yet. They don&rsquo;t know we&rsquo;re just on a globe in the middle of nothing. They&rsquo;re still hoping for aliens, for something different, like we wouldn&rsquo;t get bored in an instant and literally kill ourselves.</p>

<p>You know why they haven&rsquo;t come, right?</p>

<p>Because this thing you keep balanced in your head and heart, this thing you call &ldquo;life/reality/god&rdquo; whatever &mdash; that&rsquo;s life motherfucker. That&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ve got. And you know how it&rsquo;s a real fucking pain to balance it again every day, like you talk about nothing else your whole damn life it&rsquo;s so hard &mdash; well, that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s like to be alive. And you know the solution? Do you know it?</p>

<p>You do, I know you do.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the big reveal.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t exist. It&rsquo;s not like you don&rsquo;t exist, but there&rsquo;s a global consciousness and everything&rsquo;s connected. Nope.</p>

<p>No easy way out on this one. No way to pass it off on &ldquo;opinions&rdquo;. Look, look now: there&rsquo;s nothing. Nothing in the future. Fucking feel it you fucker, feel the future. There&rsquo;s nothing there. Feel the past, tentatively, with hands wrapped in fucking bubble wrap you fucking loser. There&rsquo;s nothing there either. We&rsquo;re trapped in the moment.</p>

<p>Oh no!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like this: Face forward, don&rsquo;t look back, don&rsquo;t try to babble to yourself in your head about what&rsquo;s really happening. Face what&rsquo;s happening. Yes that guy in the corner totally hates you for no reason. Yes, your father is a fucking douche bag who&rsquo;s just as weak as he fears. Yes, you&rsquo;re a frail little creature trying to get whatever small comforts you can. And no, for the last time, it&rsquo;s not okay to look inside and see how you really feel. It&rsquo;s not okay to ignore the problem: The problem always has been and always will be that you aren&rsquo;t strong enough to face up to the fact that you do not exist and that ignoring everything except for the moment is the only way to live, but you feel like it&rsquo;s giving up yourself, your awareness of self, which is literally nothing but a sounding board between you and reality and it&rsquo;s worthless. It&rsquo;s not even a good creation. It&rsquo;s not even something helpful or worthwhile.</p>

<p>So throw aside that doll. Stop talking to your child self, and face it: YOU ARE A CHILD OF EARTH AND YOU CAN&rsquo;T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. YOU HAVE TO HANG ON JUST LIKE THE REST OF US AND WE DON&rsquo;T, NO MATTER WHAT WE TELL YOU, WE DON&rsquo;T KNOW WHAT WE&rsquo;RE DOING OR WHERE WE&rsquo;RE GOING OR WHAT IT MEANS. Admit it&rsquo;s meaningless you pussy and talk about it, please, so I can hear your insipid blabbering horsefucked mouth tease about the issue: you&rsquo;re insecure. Really? No fucking shit. There&rsquo;s no way around that mother fucker, you hold it or you don&rsquo;t. There&rsquo;s no such thing as emotional growth. There&rsquo;s no such thing as a savior. There&rsquo;s no universal love and there&rsquo;s no one coming to save you, not even yourself. There&rsquo;s just this longing to be reconnected with what you&rsquo;ve already had and when you grab that, hold it, treasure it, and it slips through your fingers and falls out your toes: there&rsquo;s nothing left. And that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve been running from from the first moment someone gave you an excuse to feel bad for yourself.</p>

<p>Good night. Don&rsquo;t say your prayers. Just burn. Burn you slow burning candle into the everlasting night and then go out, like we all do. You leave nothing behind, not one scrap of light. So burn you cowardly fuck.</p>
