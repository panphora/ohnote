      <p>Why Kill.</p>

<p>(Not your body, that carapace of silver skin)</p>

<p>When life is not life any more. When life doesn&rsquo;t breathe, is it alive? A million screams come up because I talk of killing.</p>

<p>A million, you say? How about 6 million.</p>

<p>Misinterpret these words and cause a holocaust. One child, neglected, and the whole world crumbles around him. You have it too, locked inside the deepest parts of you, wanting to murder everything.</p>

<p>Why kill.</p>

<p>What is to kill. To bite the dust. I read a comic about Siddhartha once, he climbed into the snake and let him swallow him. Had a friend once, Siddhartha, like to think he went the same way. Want to think that, when the time comes, we all do, you know, climb over the edge willingly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m so embarrassed of talking about murder. Murder, murder, murder. Like someone&rsquo;s going to read this, take me for a killer, and police me. Dogs clawing at the front door, begging to get in and rip me to shreds.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t maintain peace by staying where you are. The tides will drag you out to sea. That&rsquo;s what they don&rsquo;t tell you, those yogis, as they wash to shore: you have to force it, wrangle it, force the snake of life/death to bury its face in your crotch.</p>

<p>What is this?</p>

<p>Guilt haunts me, like it follows me, like in the bathroom, down the stairs, stepping outside. I scratch my voice against it. It&rsquo;s only in moments when there is no scratching, when I go what seems like days without checking in, that I realize how beautifully fantastic the whole enterprise is. A whole minute without hearing that sound at the back of my head that says: you&rsquo;re wrong!</p>

<p>Listen to me, but don&rsquo;t listen to me. That&rsquo;s guilt for you, right there.</p>

<p>You see, it comes out, screams its head off, and says: did that come from me? Retreats for minutes, hours, days, years. Fuck, years. Can you believe that &ndash; guilt running a life for years?</p>

<p>And we&rsquo;re concerned about which box you belong in &ndash; but years&hellip;</p>

<p>Years.</p>

<p>See that old man go on that spiritual retreat, clear his head for once, sees the truth of a life lived below the threshold of sight.</p>

<p>years. Whole years gone by and he&rsquo;s got his head ducked down. And you wonder why Eminem makes hit records? And then you&rsquo;ve got this guy over here, talking meditation, telling you you cannot seek peace, peace finds you.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m telling you the truth when I say Anger and Forced Peace are two sides of the same coin, spinning endlessly.</p>

<p>You cannot see these angels locked in battle above you because you cannot see what you are not.</p>

<p>Take it from the beginning: you are not you. You are the world as you perceive it.</p>

<p>Kill yourself, the whole world goes too. So. You. Are. The. World.</p>

<p>Now guess why you can&rsquo;t see those angels? Because you do not encompass them. Pay attention, learn step by step the way their feathers fall, and you will see them spinning in your head.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;d think, as you get closer to feeling what it means to be God, things would get more complicated.</p>

<p>God is an illusion. What&rsquo;s his coin? The whole thing.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re ducking from the whole thing, the ENTIRE WORLD, so you see God, or maybe you don&rsquo;t. Maybe you deny him. It&rsquo;s the same. He is already part of your world.</p>

<p>Stare at a sign and don&rsquo;t read it.</p>

<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s 3 weeks later now that you&rsquo;ve learned how.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t think of a purple elephant.</p>

<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s 2 weeks later now that you&rsquo;ve learned how.</p>

<p>See a thought and don&rsquo;t judge it, don&rsquo;t place it, just let it hang although it begs for release.</p>

<p>Okay, it&rsquo;s 1 week later and a massacre of thoughts later.</p>

<p>Now, look at everything, the whole thing, everything, not your fucking body, not these memories, everything, the whole thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not big enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>See that too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>See that too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am enormous, bigger than everything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>See that too. Take it. Crush it up. Snort it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love this so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>See that too, let it go. Know for sure, without needing to explore, that it is one side of a very dangerous coin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let everything you&rsquo;ve ever heard about that phrase pass through you just as the voices that said it did. You will understand without knowing exactly where they come from.</p>

<p>Let it go.</p>

<p>Let everything go.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I need to stop, slow down, I&rsquo;m losing myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>See that feeling. You&rsquo;re just with feelings now. Everything is a vibration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Welcome to the world.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let that thought go, but see it first. Ask, if you must: &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; It turns out you never knew, not once, and never will.</p>

<p>It will try to start the narrative a million times again:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The world&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What if&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Let it go. Watch it work. Watch it as it gets embarrassed. Watch it as it undresses. Watch it as it tells you things you never wanted to know. Watch it as you expand far beyond your comfort level. Watch it as you make new friends. Watch it as you think they understand you. Watch it as somehow, you find a way to let them go.</p>

<p>Why let go?</p>

<p>Because you are not alive if you are not here and you are not here if you are holding onto something.</p>

<p>You are not here&hellip; if you are holding on.</p>

<p>Trust me.</p>

<p>You are not here, if even one thought appears in your mind. Let it go, force it out, but let it go. And watch the entire system collapse and be contained in your fingertip.</p>

<p>And then turn you inside out.</p>

<p>And then drag you along through centuries of pain and suffering.</p>

<p>And then show you what a decade feels like.</p>

<p>And then show you everything you&rsquo;re missing from your life.</p>

<p>And then show you everyone you&rsquo;ve ever been to every single person in your life: every judgment, every small dismissal, every act you didn&rsquo;t think would matter.</p>

<p>Watch as you grow big while feeling small.</p>

<p>Watch as you grow instantaneously small as you latch onto something big.</p>

<p>Watch.</p>

<p>And then let go of the watcher, and don&rsquo;t watch as it screams and dies, forever in the past, dead. Murdered.</p>
