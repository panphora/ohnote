      <p>I tried to bury it in the back yard, took out a shovel and picked up some dirt. The shovel became an extension of my arm. There is no room in this world for shovel-arms. So, at night some times, I uncork my brain and let it flow into the galaxy. I feel the light from stars you&rsquo;ve never even seen. And then, in the morning, I put on my human suit and march to the tune of the worst, most depressing shit I&rsquo;ve ever heard in my life....</p>

      <p>Why Kill. (Not your body, that carapace of silver skin) When life is not life any more. When life doesn&rsquo;t breathe, is it alive? A million screams come up because I talk of killing. A million, you say? How about 6 million. Misinterpret these words and cause a holocaust. One child, neglected, and the whole world crumbles around him. You have it too, locked inside the deepest parts of you, wanting to murder everything....</p>

      <p>I tried, tried the whisper at the door, looked between the seesaw, saw a child&rsquo;s face, but you know how you can fudge it, like you reach out with your eyes and at the last instant before they touch, you blur the picture, ah yes, a thing I recognize the mind says, but really it&rsquo;s not a baby, it&rsquo;s not a human, it&rsquo;s something unfamiliar, why kill yourself over it, why worry so much, it&rsquo;s true, not worth it, not worth the trouble of a wandering mind, just come back, every time, hating yourself, sure, but even then, why, you don&rsquo;t think these spiritual teachers sit alone inside their chambers and don&rsquo;t know what to tell themselves, think about elephants and triceratops who did it so much better than them, had such a bigger impact on the world, because words, really, they just glance, it&rsquo;s only a presence, a caring presence, that has life to it, the rest just glances off, even mass murders, even things like World War II, they just bounce off like the sun&rsquo;s rays, even Jesus, schizophrenic that he was, his love just bounces off and doesn&rsquo;t land anywhere, just gets carried away in the mind of some young savior, and I write this stuff as some kind of antidote?...</p>

      <p>I watched, waited, sometimes knew what was coming, I stayed, I waited, watched for you on the train, knew you were coming someday, knew the light would flood the streets, the car would pull up, and you, dear you, with eyes like sunlight, would step out into my arms, and oh, I&rsquo;d hold you and we&rsquo;d kiss in the moonlight, but your eyes, full of sunlight, would shoot up to the moon and blur it&rsquo;s fuzzy light into oblivion, and the moon, the jealous moon, would tell the sun, and the sun would send spaceships from its core on a secret mission to find out who you are, and it would find out that you are the same, the core that lives within you is the core that lives within the sun, converting subatomic particles to higher forms of energy by the process known as magic, which rules the universe and the beings would get out of their car and come up behind us while I was holding you and you&rsquo;d seen it coming, in fact set up our whole relationship just for this scene, them clamping something on the back of your neck, and dragging you into the car, and me, forlorn on the street corner, stranded in front of the movie theatre, I&rsquo;d watch you go, as if everything at once was leaving their soul behind, but letting their bodies get carried away by the tide, she&rsquo;d take you back to the core of the sun, and you&rsquo;d party like it was 1999 and you&rsquo;d see that it was all a sham, including me, including the story that was that night, that kiss, did we even kiss, yes I remember it clearly now, that kiss in front of the movie theatre just before we went in and saw Jackie Chan jump over that fence in that movie with Concords in the title, and I gasped and frowned and beat my eye lashes at the flashes, the movie cinematographers flirting with me through a mix-match of colors on the screen, oh how they flirt, playful is my favorite, but sharp spikes to the heart work too when all you understand is anger or want to pretend like it&rsquo;s all you understand just to spite all those little hearts that&rsquo;s don&rsquo;t speak your language, you buzzing like a puppet on a screen, heart pulsing like a wildfire, sitting next to me, my soul, my life, my one true hold, the fire flight of too many fishes swimming through the aquarium of my skin all at once, but you see it all, and not in 20&frasl;20, but in the moment, like you can see with your body, like you are, you understand, the heart of the ever burning sun, begging us all with every breath to understand also that everything, everything at once is crying the biggest, longest sob in recorded history and it&rsquo;s a shame to be a part of it without knowing it, because, as we all know, practicing for the main event, that gasp before the final sniffle, that audible thing, that expulsion that is a sob, that, we are practicing for, with every breath, knowing that the climax of sadness is just as meaningful, just as patterned and breathless and necessary for the language of what it means not for human/animal/or earth herself, but for the ever reaching expanse that you will never reach the end of because she&rsquo;s crawling ever away from you and you, you are regretting every second of it, pulling away from the expanse that some call love because all they see is hate, and some call spirit because all they see are lies, and some call life because all they see is what we point them to, marching along into the longest song that you&rsquo;ll ever hear, hating yourself for all the life you could not breathe in, hating yourself for accepting, way back when, that lie they told you but hesitate to remember because we never believe what we do not want to be true....</p>

      <p>Start with death and move backwards, start with a baby, newly born, and put it back in, reverse time, have it climb up the highway into those 9 long months and melt it&rsquo;s eyes down to nothing, just an amoeba, now two creatures, sperm and egg, meeting in the darkness, is this death? If you ask the baby, look at egg and sperm and tell me: is this you, what does the baby say?...</p>

      <p>I wanted to love you, wanted to curl you in my arms and let you know that no snail so small and slimy could ever escape my eyes, my heart, red-rosed blooming for you, wanted to care for you in a place called ever or everlasting or forever, let you pick yourself a castle in the clouds and bring it down with cannonballs of heartbeats, but instead I let you choose a word, one word, and call it anything, I told you I will give you it all and I packaged it with red lips, though I have none, in a space I circle with tired feet, and let you gaze upon it and we called it love, a child deformed by the hands of human craftsmanship and we asked them, those men of industry, if they planned to die, and they said &ldquo;never&rdquo; and we took that word, or the last part of it, the part before the period at the end of the sentence, or maybe not even that, maybe just the whisper of a groan before the 20th century collapsed into the 21st, you know I was born at the peak of civilization, you told me, in bed, is whispers, and I never told you I was a poet writing about the end of the world, not because it mattered, but because this way I could enjoy it more....</p>

      <p>Water follows tears inside you, reach for the lover on the handlebar, where the light comes through it never shows, far above on the high stakes, airplanes, buildings, no, but anything that flies, flies like flapping feathers on your fingertips, tap, tap, wandering on the wishes of your spine, I love you because you let me love you, no other reason is ever enough, never, I only love you once, when you&rsquo;re a baby, and never again, never loved an adult, see the fear in all the dogs eyes, bowed heads, slaves, no, happy slaves, but no, dogs are beautiful, happy dogs are like cats with mice in their claws, like a dog is just breathing the air like a cat wants to breathe the smell of squeaky mice, not true, but good, too hard to define anything really, didn&rsquo;t mean those things about adults, just like the wide eyes better, the empty heads better, the ears with so much ear wax somehow they can hear better better, you know, you know, right?...</p>
