      <p>Truth: when anything delivers nothing, no one, all, I want to be the one standing above, when you cry out that you&rsquo;ve lost your mother, and your child hasn&rsquo;t come home, there&rsquo;s this little wisp of a feeling hanging above your head, before it all disappears, when your confidence in this life slips through your head and you can&rsquo;t stand or walk away because the wreckage of all you&rsquo;ve known is washing to shore at once, I will be there, talking with the bones, wishing in your head, making the clouds part, making the sun shine down on tired shoulders, and you will look away, down to the smallest insect and wish you were him looking up at yourself, looking up at me, and you&rsquo;ll wish something you&rsquo;ll never say, something you&rsquo;ll never have the courage to even get the opportunity to squander, but I&rsquo;ll be there, above your head, holding your fire, making sure it doesn&rsquo;t go out until we blow that flame out together, and you&rsquo;ll wish I wasn&rsquo;t there, voyeuring your experience, trampling the grains of sand that were your life, even breathing the voice of that lover you never quite managed to dream into existence, laughing, smiling, twirling in some field made of the smiles of your everlasting children, burning the memory palace down around your ankles, wishing for something to make sense and knowing, in a heart you&rsquo;ve long abandoned, what true misery feels like. Building a life like putting checkmarks on a calendar, washing your face of the one you wore yesterday, hoping they don&rsquo;t find it, knowing they can&rsquo;t, but you&rsquo;re so damn forgetful it all washes off anyways and sinks you slowly down the drain, through the pipes of a full days work, scrubbing the itch from your hungry heart, and plummeting you into the next bath tub, falling out of the shower head, slipping, catching, holding, almost falling with the speed of the earth, slipping, wishing, and being sucked down and out through your own anus into nothing, nothing at all, just a bland darkness that feels like: every lie a look that everyone refuses to tell you, but wants to own up to, but kills in infancy, shame, darkness, death, no good personalities lumped into a carcass in the corner that tomorrow you&rsquo;re somehow going to have to make look brand new.</p>
